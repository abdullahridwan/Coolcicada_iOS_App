# Coolcicada_iOS_App


* main branch has an initial implementation of the idea
* to allow users to save and fetch data, the "with_firebase" branch integrates firebase with the initial implementation
* Includes a login page with firebase authentication
* Structed data in firestore and writing methods to allow for data fetching, loading. 
* Will Update as I continue! 
* Thinking of pivoting this to a passion project of mine since the foundations are the same.
